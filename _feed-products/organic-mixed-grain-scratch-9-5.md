description: Our Mixed Grain Scratch, at 9.5% protein, provides an ideal supplement
  to all birds. Corn is cracked while the rest of the grains are whole.   Feeding
  whole grains with grit helps keep the bird’s gizzard strong and healthy and improves
  the flavour of the final product.

  ALL GRAIN INGREDIENTS GROWN AT BARNYARD ORGANICS (home of EAST COAST ORGANIC FEED MILL) except corn (source:  Le Moulins des Cèdres, QC)
directions: Use as a supplement with the Organic Poultry Layer Mash.  Be sure to offer
  plenty of fresh water to ensure your birds are happy and healthy.  Store in a cool,
