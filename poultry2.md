  heading: Organic Mixed Grain Scratch 9.5%
  description: Our Mixed Grain Scratch, at 9.5% protein, provides an ideal supplement
    to all birds. Corn is cracked while the rest of the grains are whole.   Feeding
    whole grains with grit helps keep the bird’s gizzard strong and healthy and improves
    the flavour of the final product.

    mash is a medium hammered texture, easy for young chicks to eat. The mash is preferred
    by many because it is not over-processed into pellets.  Cracked corn is used in
    the mash to minimize dust levels.
