description:
  For egg production or maintenance of adult birds (chickens, geese, ducks),
  the 17% protein will meet the requirements of most mixed farms. The mash is preferred
  by many because it is not over-processed into pellets.  Cracked corn is used in
  the mash to minimize dust levels.
ingredients: |-
  Organic Barley, Roasted Organic Soybean, Organic Corn, Organic Field Peas, Organic Wheat, Organic Flax Meal & Bio Ag Poultry Layer Mineral Premix*.  

  *BioAg mineral premixes include a variety of primary and trace minerals and vitamins, from sources such as: limestone; kelp meal; natural trace mineral salt; DL methionine and lysine in the layer mash (amino acids); selenium yeast; probiotics; enzymes; vitamins A, D, and E, plus vitamin B complex in addition to those vitamins in the premix.

directions:
  Recommended for hens 20 (+) weeks or once they begin laying eggs.  Keep
  bottom of feeders level with the top of the backs of your hens to minimize wastage.
  Offer plenty of fresh water away from feed.  Offer appropriate-sized, free-choice
  grit to aid digestion.  Store in a cool, dry place. Unlike many pelletized feeds,
  our feeds are whole grain and contain no preservatives.  Do not use if mouldy or
