  ration.  Be sure to offer plenty of fresh water to ensure your pigs are happy and
  healthy.  Store in a cool, dry place. Unlike many pelletized feeds, our feeds are
  whole grain and contain no preservatives.  Do not use if mouldy or wet and aim to
  use the product within three months of purchase.
